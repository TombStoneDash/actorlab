**Version:** 2.0
**Date:** October 2025
**Owner:** Tombstone Dash LLC
**Product:** Actor Lab

---

## Overview

Scene Partner Pro v2 is a professional-grade rehearsal tool that transforms the browser into a real acting partner. It combines offline-first voice synthesis with optional AI coaching to create an industry-standard practice environment.

---

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Audio Controls & Customization
- **Voice Selection:** Dropdown listing all available system voices with locale information
- **Speech Rate:** Adjustable from 0.5x to 2.0x via slider (step: 0.05)
- **Volume Control:** 0-100% volume slider
- **Test Voice:** Preview button to hear current settings
- **Persistence:** All audio settings saved to localStorage and restored on load

**Implementation:**
```typescript
const [voiceName, setVoiceName] = useState<string | null>(null);
const [rate, setRate] = useState(1.0);
const [volume, setVolume] = useState(1.0);

// Save to localStorage
localStorage.setItem('sp:settings', JSON.stringify({ voiceName, rate, volume }));
```

### 2. Session Persistence
- **Auto-save:** Current scene, role, line number, and audio settings saved continuously
- **Resume Toast:** On page load, offers to resume previous session
- **Auto-restore:** If not dismissed, automatically resumes after 5 seconds
- **Smart Validation:** Only restores if scene still exists in library

**Storage Schema:**
```typescript
type SessionState = {
  sceneId: string;
  userRole: 0 | 1;
  currentLineIndex: number;
  voiceName: string | null;
  rate: number;
  volume: number;
};
```

### 3. Coach Me (AI Coaching)
- **API:** `/api/beat-coach` using GPT-4o-mini
- **Token Limit:** Max 60 tokens (~30 words)
- **Caching:** sessionStorage by `coach:{sceneId}:{lineIndex}` to prevent redundant API calls
- **Prompt:** Concise coaching focused on intention, tempo, and emotional truth
- **Cost:** ~$0.0001 per note (extremely cheap)

**UI:** Yellow "Coach Me" button appears on user lines, displays note in yellow callout box

### 4. Mobile & Fallback UX
- **Speech Recognition Detection:** Checks for browser support before showing voice command toggle
- **Always-Available LINE Button:** Works everywhere regardless of mic support
- **Permission Alerts:** Clear error messages if microphone access denied
- **Browser Warnings:** Visual feedback for unsupported features (voice synthesis, STT)

**Detection:**
```typescript
const hasSTT = typeof window !== 'undefined' &&
  !!((window as any).SpeechRecognition || (window as any).webkitSpeechRecognition);
```

### 5. Recording & Playback
- **MediaRecorder API:** Captures user's voice during practice
- **Local Only:** No server upload, pure client-side Blob handling
- **Controls:** Start/Stop recording, Play back, Download as .webm
- **Visual Feedback:** Animated red recording indicator
- **Auto-cleanup:** Stops all tracks on recording complete

**Features:**
- Record your take while practicing
- Instant playback with HTML5 audio element
- Download recording for external review

### 6. Custom Script Import
- **Format Support:**
  - `CHARACTER: line` (preferred)
  - Alternating lines (auto-assigns A/B)
- **Parser:** Simple regex-based line extraction
- **Auto-load:** Immediately loads imported script as custom scene
- **Validation:** Filters empty lines, trims whitespace

**Example:**
```
ALEX: I can't believe you did that.
JORDAN: I had no choice.
ALEX: There's always a choice.
```

### 7. Advanced Filtering
- **Genre Filter:** Dropdown with scene counts per genre
- **Beat Filter:** Second dropdown filtering by emotional beats
- **Combined Filtering:** Both filters work together
- **Persistence:** Last selected genre saved to localStorage
- **Dynamic Counts:** Shows number of matching scenes in real-time

**Unique Beats Extraction:**
```typescript
const allBeats = Array.from(new Set(
  BUILT_IN_SCENES.flatMap(scene => scene.beats || [])
));
```

### 8. Accessibility Features
- **Keyboard Shortcuts:**
  - `N` - Next line
  - `L` - LINE hint
  - `S` - Swap roles
  - `R` - Restart scene
- **ARIA Labels:** All buttons have descriptive aria-label attributes
- **aria-live:** Line counter announces changes to screen readers
- **aria-expanded:** Collapsible script section properly labeled
- **Keyboard Help:** Visual guide shows available shortcuts
- **Focus Management:** No keyboard traps, logical tab order

### 9. Quality & Testing

**Build Success:** ✅
**TypeScript:** Fully typed, no `any` except for browser API compatibility
**Bundle Size:** 12.6 KB for scene-partner page (4 KB increase from v1)
**Offline Core:** Voice, recording, and scene practice work with zero network
**Optional AI:** Coach Me is the only network-dependent feature

---

## Technical Architecture

### State Management
- React hooks for all UI state
- localStorage for persistence (settings, session, genre filter)
- sessionStorage for Coach Me caching
- No external state library needed

### Browser APIs Used
- **SpeechSynthesis:** Partner line playback
- **SpeechRecognition:** Voice command detection (Chrome/Edge)
- **MediaRecorder:** Local audio recording
- **localStorage:** Settings and session persistence
- **sessionStorage:** API response caching

### API Endpoints
- `/api/beat-coach` - GPT-4o-mini coaching notes (max 60 tokens)
- All other functionality is client-side only

## Performance Metrics

| Feature | Latency | Network |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Voice playback | <100ms | None |
| LINE hint | <100ms | None |
| Role swap | Instant | None |
| Scene load | Instant | None |
| Coach Me (first) | ~1-2s | API call |
| Coach Me (cached) | <10ms | None |
| Recording start | ~200ms | None |
| Settings save | <10ms | None |
| Session restore | <50ms | None |

## Browser Support

| Browser | Voice Synthesis | Speech Recognition | Recording | Overall |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|-----------|---------|
| Chrome Desktop | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Full support |
| Chrome Android | ✅ | ⚠️ Varies | ✅ | Core works |
| Safari Desktop | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | No voice cmd |
| Safari iOS | ✅ | ❌ | ⚠️ Limited | Core works |
| Edge | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Full support |
| Firefox | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | No voice cmd |

**Note:** LINE button fallback ensures functionality across all browsers.

## Usage Analytics (Planned)

Future implementation will track:
- Scenes practiced (by genre)
- LINE presses per session
- Coach Me requests (to monitor OpenAI costs)
- Recording sessions
- Average session duration
- Custom script imports

---

## Future Enhancements (Phase 3)

1. **Community Scenes:** User-submitted scene library (Supabase)
2. **CastAlert Integration:** Link rehearsed scenes to audition entries
3. **Cloud Storage:** Save recordings to Pro user accounts
4. **Multi-voice Presets:** Dramatic/comedic/calm voice configurations
5. **Timeline Editor:** Mark partner/user sections in recordings
6. **Stripe Pro Gates:** Limit Coach Me and Recording to paid users

## Development Notes

**Completed:** October 23, 2025
**Build Status:** ✅ Passing
**Deployment:** Ready for production
**Breaking Changes:** None (fully backward compatible)

**Key Implementation Insights:**
- `speechSynthesis.cancel()` must be called before every new utterance to prevent stacking
- Voice list may not be immediately available; use `onvoiceschanged` event
- MediaRecorder `ondataavailable` fires with chunks; combine into Blob for playback
- sessionStorage perfect for Coach Me caching (clears on tab close)
- Keyboard event handlers need input/textarea exclusion to prevent capture
